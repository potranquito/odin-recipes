    <p>Follow this recipe step by step:</p>
    <p><strong>Cheese Filling</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Meat Sauce</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>¾ lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>40 oz. marinara sauce, see notes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Lasagna Noodles + Cheese</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage</li>
        <li>2.5 cups mozarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cooking Instructions</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Prep Work</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Preheat Oven and Cook The Noodles</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
        <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Assemble</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
        <li><b>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</b></li>
        <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Bake and Cool</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
    </ol>
